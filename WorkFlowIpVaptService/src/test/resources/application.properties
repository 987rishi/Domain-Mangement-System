# TEST-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
# This file overrides src/main/resources/application.properties
# during the 'mvn test' or 'mvn verify' phase.
# Its purpose is to create a self-contained environment for tests.
# ===================================================================

# --- General Application Settings for Tests ---
spring.application.name=workflow-service-test
# Set the server port to 0 to use a random, available port for web-related tests.
# This prevents port conflicts during parallel test execution.
server.port=0

# --- Database Configuration: Use H2 In-Memory Database ---
# This is the most important change. Tests should NOT connect to a real PostgreSQL DB.
# Using H2 makes tests fast and independent of any running database.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
# Use 'create-drop' to ensure a clean database schema for every test run.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
spring.jpa.show-sql=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

# --- Service Discovery: Disable Eureka Client ---
# Tests should not attempt to register with a Eureka server. This would
# slow down tests and make them fail if Eureka is not running.
eureka.client.enabled=false

# --- Email Configuration: Use Dummy Values ---
# Tests should not send real emails. Provide dummy values to satisfy the configuration
# properties and prevent the application from failing to start.
spring.mail.host=localhost
spring.mail.port=2525
spring.mail.username=testuser@example.com
spring.mail.password=dummypassword
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=false
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=false

# --- Feign Client Settings ---
# It's good practice to keep these settings to help debug Feign-related tests.
logging.level.feign=DEBUG
spring.cloud.openfeign.cache.enabled=false
spring.cloud.openfeign.pageable.enabled=false
spring.cloud.openfeign.client.decodeSlash=false

# --- Custom Application Properties: Provide Dummy Values ---
# Provide dummy values for any custom properties required by your application
# to prevent "Could not resolve placeholder" errors.
WEBHOOK_SECRET=dummy-webhook-secret-for-testing
notification.sender.email=test-notifications@example.com
notification.subject.prefix=[TEST-Domain Expiration]

# Use a "never-run" cron expression to disable the scheduler during tests.
# This expression runs on February 29th, which is safe for most test runs.
scheduler.cron.expression=0 0 0 29 2 ?

# --- Actuator Endpoints ---
# Disable endpoints unless you are specifically testing them.
